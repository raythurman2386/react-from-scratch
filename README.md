# React from Scratch

Creating a react app without the use of CRA

Will possibly turn into my next side project

Using Parcel, ESlint, prettier

### Run the dev server

```
npm run dev
```

### Format the document

If your prettier is not set up to format on save run the following command

```
npm run format
```

### Lint the document

Linting available with eslint using recommended settings

```
npm run lint
```
